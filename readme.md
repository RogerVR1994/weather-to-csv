# Weather recorr for Dallas, TX

----------------

### Problem
    - Create a Windows Service with C#
    -Every 5 minutes, the service should log the current weather in Dallas, TX to a CSV file (use any free weather API they like)
    -The file format should be:
        -Temperature (numeric value)
        -Units (C/F)
        -Precipitation (true/false)
        -Upload the solution to GitHub and share with Daniel
    -Bonus points if the solution runs successfully in debug mode
