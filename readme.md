# Weather recorr for Dallas, TX
------------------------

### Problem
    1. Create a Windows Service with C#
    2. Every 5 minutes, the service should log the current weather in Dallas, TX to a CSV file (use any free weather API they like)
    3. The file format should be:
        1. Temperature (numeric value)
        2. Units (C/F)
        3. Precipitation (true/false)
        4. Upload the solution to GitHub and share with Daniel
    4. Bonus points if the solution runs successfully in debug mode
